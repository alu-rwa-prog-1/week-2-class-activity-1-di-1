Flutter Widgets Assignment

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

Form small groups of 2- 3 and come up with an exercise that incorporates all these widgets and build. 

Each group will have a researcher who checks the documentation on how to implement a widget/component, coder, and debugger to ensure good code quality. Roles will be swapped after every 5 mins.
